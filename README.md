**OMG Emotion Dataset** 

Our One-Minute-Gradual Emotion Dataset (OMG-Emotion Dataset) is composed of 420 relatively long emotion videos with an average length of 1 minute, collected from a variety of Youtube channels. The videos were selected automatically based on specific search terms related to the term monologue. Using monologue videos allowed for different emotional behaviors  to be presented in one context that changed gradually over time.. Videos were separated into clips based on utterances, and each utterance was annotated by at least five independent subjects using the Amazon Mechanical Turk tool. To maintain the contextual information for each video, each annotator watched the clips of a video in sequence and had to annotate each video using an arousal/valence scale.

Each annotator was also given the full contextual information of the video up to that point when annotating the dataset. That means that each annotator could take into consideration not only the vision and audio information but also the context of each video, i.e. what was spoken in the current and previous utterances through the context clips provided by the annotation tool. In this manner, each annotation is based on multimodal information, different from most recent datasets on emotion recognition. This gives our corpus an advantage when used in cross-modal research, especially when analyzing the audio, vision, and language modalities.

**Annotations and Labels** 

We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to create utterance-level annotation for each video, exemplified in the Figure below. We assure that for each video have a total of 5 different annotations. To make sure that the contextual information was taken into consideration, the annotator watched the whole video in a sequence and was asked, after each utterance, to annotate the arousal and valence of what was displayed. We provide a gold standard for the annotations. This results in trustworthy labels that are truly representative of the subjective annotations from each of the annotators, providing an objective metric for evaluation. That means that for each utterance we have one value of arousal and valence. We then calculate the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) for each video, which represents the correlation between the annotations and varies from -1 (total disagreement) to 1 (total agreement).

We release the dataset with the gold standar for arousal and valence as well the invidivual annotations for each reviewer, which can help the development of different models. We will calculate the final CCC against the goldstandard for each video. We also distribute the transcripts of what was spoken in each of the videos, as the contextual information is important to determine gradual emotional change through the utterances. The participants are encouraged to use crossmodal information in their models, as the videos were labeled by humans without distinction of any modality. 
We also will let available to the participant teams a set of scripts which will help them to pre-process the dataset and evaluate their model during in the training phase.

**Dataset Structure** 

The dataset is separated into the following files:

- omg_TrainVideos.csv
- omg_ValidationVideos.csv
- DetailedAnnotations 
- omg_TrainTranscripts.csv 
- omg_TestTranscripts.csv

Each of the data CSV files contain the following information:


link: The link to access the youtube video
start:  the timestamp where the video starts
end: the timestamp where the video ends
video: the video-id, used to associate the video with the annotations
utterance: the utterance name, used to associate the video with the annotations
arousal: the calculated goldstandard of the arousal
valence: the calculated goldstandard of the valence
emotionMaxVote: the resulting categorical emotion from voting over all annotations

the transcripts csvs contain the following information:

link: The link to access the youtube video
video: the video-id, used to associate the video with the annotations
utterance: the utterance name, used to associate the video with the annotations
transcript: The transcript of the audio from each videoHow to participate

We compute the arousal/valence value of a model with the goldstandard of the test set. The categorical emotion will not be used for evaluating the model, but could be usefull when designing or training your model. The categorical emotion is encoded as follows: 
- 0 -  Anger
- 1 - Disgust 
- 2 - Fear 
- 3 - Happy 
- 4 - Neutral 
- 5 - Sad 
- 6 - Surprise

The DetailedAnnotations folder contains all the annotations for each utterance. Each annotation was made when taking into consideration the video as part of a sequence, so it could be useful to use this additional information when designing your 
models.

The Transcripts folder contains all the transcripts for each of the utterance in the dataset.

**Baselines**

To serve a baseline for this challenge, we used three different modesl: one for each modality. 

The vision baseline was made with an updated version of the Face channel [1] pre-trained on the FER+ dataset and fine-tuned with 10 randomly selected faces of each training utterance.

We have two audio baselines, the first one was made with an updated version of the Audio channel [1] pre-trained on the RAVDESS.

The second one was made by using the opensmile library to extract auditory features and a Suport Vector Machine (SVM) to classify them.

The baseline text classifier is trained on the OMG training data and
uses the word2vec Google News corpus vectors as pretrained word
embeddings. The model feeds the transcribed sentences as sequences of
word embeddings into a 1D CNN with 128 filters and a kernel size of 3.

The CNN is followed by a global max pooling layer and a fully connected
layer with 500 units, ending finally in a single neuron with a sigmoidal
activation function that predicts the valence and arousal levels of the
input utterance. The CNN and fully connected layer use a ReLU activation
and a dropout factor of 0.2 is applied after the word embedding and
fully connected layer.

We calculate the Congruence Correlation Coeficient (CCC) and Mean-Squared Error (MSE) for both arousal and valence of the validation set only.

| Modality  | CCC Arousal | CCC Valence | MSE Arousal | MSE Valence | 
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Vision - Face Channel [1]   | 0.12  | 0.23 | 0.053 | 0.12 |
| Audio - Audio Channel [1]   | 0.08  | 0.10 | 0.048 | 0.12 |
| Audio - OpenSmile Features | 0.15  | 0.21 | 0.045 | 0.10 |
| Text   | 0.05  | 0.20 | 0.062 | 0.123 |

**Scripts** 

We provide the following scripts:

- prepare_data.py: a script used to read, download, cut and organize the dataset.
- calculateEvaluationCCC.py: a script used to calculate the Correlation Concordance Coeficient (CCC) of the output of a model and the validation set. The file with the model's output must be a CSV file containng the following information: 

```
